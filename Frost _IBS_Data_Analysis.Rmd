```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

The goal of this Rmd file is to create a reproducible set of code that will allow future people to repeat this analysis on 16S metagenomic data received from MRDNA. 

```{r libraries}
#library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
#library(here)
#library(skimr) 
#library(kableExtra)
#library(janitor)
#library(paletteer)
```

```{r Data Loading}

```

```{r Cleaning Data}
phylum_na<-read_excel(("Frost IBS Original Data.xlsx"), na="0")
##This code reads in the original data file and replaces all of the 0 values with NA which allows for easier cleaning
```

```{r Displaying Data in a Table}
##Going to want to add in the mean, median, standard deviation and alpha diversity in some way
```


```{r Graphing}

```
